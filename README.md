## Proof of Concept: Using Mocha or Jasmine to test Lightning Components

Please note that this is intended to be a simple POC and uses vanilla versions of the corresponding test libraries. Mocha/Jasmine are not LockerService compliant out of the box, so the POC only works with LockerService disabled. Lightning Test Service MVP should support/run with LockerService.
